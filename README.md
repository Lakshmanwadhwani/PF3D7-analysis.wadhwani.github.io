### Welcome to my page! I am really interested in mosquito's and the diseases they transmit. In my personal case it would be malaria which is transmitted by the anopheles mosquito, the definitive host of the plasmodium falciparum parasite. So lets take a peak at the genome of this unicellular protozoan parasite!

I am going to use the programming language R to do some basic statistcal analysis and then swithc to python to do some more advanced stuff like amino acid compostion etc.So lets delve right into it. Instructions for downloading R can be located in my R install folder. We would also need to install Bioconductor. Instruction that also can be located in the bioconductor folder. 

First we would need to retrieve genome sequence data from NCBI. Please refer to my folder titled **P.Falciparum 3d7 download** for the fasta files. 
We begin the data acquisition process by going to the NCBI website [](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
