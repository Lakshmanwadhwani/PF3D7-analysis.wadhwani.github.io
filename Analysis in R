#Assuming that R is installed,thus we skip installation instructions
#However we will load some essential packages for our needs. First open up the R program on your computer by clicking on the R icon.
#We will be installing bioconductor. Bioconductor contains several R packages custom made for analysis of biological data.

#Instead of going to the NCBI website to retrieve sequence data from the NCBI database, you can retrieve sequence
data from NCBI directly from R, by using the SeqinR R package.

> getncbiseq <- function(accession)
{
require("seqinr") # this function requires the SeqinR R package
# first find which ACNUC database the accession is stored in:
dbs <- c("genbank","refseq","refseqViruses","bacterial")
numdbs <- length(dbs)
for (i in 1:numdbs)
{
db <- dbs[i]
choosebank(db)
# check if the sequence is in ACNUC database 'db':
resquery <- try(query(".tmpquery", paste("AC=", accession)), silent = TRUE)
if (!(inherits(resquery, "try-error")))
{
queryname <- "query2"
thequery <- paste("AC=",accession,sep="")
query(`queryname`,`thequery`)

 #see if a sequence was retrieved:
 seq <- getSequence(query2$req[[1]])

 return(seq)
 }
